<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antireflective Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Deposition</li><li>Electronic Beam Evaporation</li><li>Sputtering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antireflective coatings market comprises several types of deposition techniques: vacuum deposition, electronic beam evaporation, and sputtering. Vacuum deposition involves the application of thin films in a controlled vacuum, enhancing optical clarity without reflections. Electronic beam evaporation utilizes a focused beam to vaporize materials, forming uniform coatings. Sputtering, on the other hand, entails bombarding a target material with ions to dislodge particles, which then deposit onto the substrate, offering durable and effective antireflective properties. Each technique caters to specific application needs and performance requirements.</p></p>
